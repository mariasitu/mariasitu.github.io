          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Climbing is largely considered to be a friendly and social sport with great communities, but a problem I've noticed is that people are having a hard time finding popular climbing routes and gyms while visiting new or unfamiliar areas.</p>
          <p>Why is there no easy way to share knowledge about great outdoor climbs or indoor gyms?</p>
          <p>Having experienced this problem myself and being an avid and passionate member of the rock climbing community, I decided this was a problem that I wanted to use my design skills to tackle.</p>

          <p>Enter The Climbing Beta. The Climbing Beta gives users a solution for searching for climbing routes and gyms in areas they might not be familiar with.</p>
          <p>Because the reviews and information given are 100% crowd-sourced, users get the benefit of utilizing different local communities for honest and reliable reviews.</p>

        <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
        <p>In order to gauge how people in the climbing community were accessing information, I conducted some quick informal interviews during multiple sessions at the local climbing gym.
        <p>I asked climbers:</p>
        <p>1) where they went to get recommendations for good climbs while traveling to unfamiliar areas</p>
        <p>2) how much they trusted the information they gathered</p>
        <p>What I learned was that:</p>
        <div class="list-text">
          <ul class="side-by-side">
            <li><p>most climbers primarily rely on word-of-mouth recommendations and physical guide books when looking for new climbing routes</p></li>
            <li><p>others use sites like Google search reviews, Yelp, and Facebook as supplemental resources</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="list-text">
          <ul class="side-by-side">
            <li><p>the most trustworthy recommendations were from friends or fellow climbers</p></li>
            <li><p>second to that were sites like Mountain Project (hosted by REI) and reddit but many climbers stated not liking the clutteredness of the UI</p></li>

            <h6>Key Takeaways</h6>
            <p>Yelp is good for the sheer quantity of reviews and ratings but their sponsored content, ads, and cluttered interface take away from the user experience.</p>
            <p>Facebook is a good resource for recommendations because you can receive information from trusted individuals within your social circle. This is also one of its major limitations, sometimes recommendations are limited by the size and diversity of your social circle and timing of a post can affect the amount of people who view it.</p>
            <p>Google search and reviews is great in that it can utilize the power of the search engine and automatically provides location data based on your search results.</p>

            <p>Building on the insights gained from the informal interviews and the competitive analysis, I decided to conduct a more structured online user survey in order to further gauge users' behaviors on these review sites.

      <h2>Defining the brand identity</h2>
      <p>The Climbing Beta's main purpose is to help users find potential climbing routes and gyms through crowd-sourced reviews.</p>
      <p>I started the branding process by thinking about the physical act of climbing and breaking it down into its simplest form - hands, rock, and chalk (sometimes).</p>
      <h6>Logo exploration</h6>
      <p>I began brainstorming for the logo by drawing word maps and then choosing some of those words and finding symbols and graphics that represented them. Through peer feedback and senior logo designer input, I was able to combine a lot of elements from all four logo drafts to create the final logo.</p>

      <h6>Colorography</h6>
      <p>While brainstorming for Primary colors, I came across this description "Blue is strongly associated with feelings of trust, dependability, and calmness" which are all things I want the site to inspire in it’s design to the users. I decided to go with a mixture of a monotone and triad color scheme - incorporating cool grays and blacks as secondary colors for support.</p>
      <h6>Typography</h6>
      <p>Primary font - Oswald is a sans serif font whose design is heavily influenced by ‘Alternate Gothic’ which is described as “Robust, dark, and coolly competent, Alternate Gothic is a good choice when strong typographic statements must fit into tight spaces".</p>
      <p>Secondary font - Roboto Condensed is a versatile san-serif font that pairs well with Oswald. Most descriptions on the site will be in paragraph form and this font feels the most similar to text you would find in a travel guide - which pairs well with the feelings and theme for this website.</p>

        <h2>Reflections and moving forward</h2>
        <p>I had a lot of fun working on this project because of my personal affinity for rock climbing. The Climbing Beta was a nice exercise in creating a website concept that solved the problem of information access and allowed users to share information and rate places or climbs for the rock climbing community.</p>
        <p>Given more time I would add a terminology page or index - something to help the more novice users of the site understand the climbing jargon better.</p>
        <p>All in all, I had a lot of fun designing a tool for an activity that I am passionate about. I learned that most of the time less is better, don’t stack box shadows - if there is one level of elevation then that should be enough, and that there is way more real estate on desktop than mobile so you have to be very intentional and strategic with what you place and where.</p>
